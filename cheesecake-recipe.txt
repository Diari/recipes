Ingredients
-75g/2½oz butter, melted, plus extra for greasing
-175g/6oz digestive biscuits
-175g/6oz blueberries, plus extra for decorating
-450g/1lb cream cheese
-150g/5½oz caster sugar
-1 tsp vanilla extract
-4 free-range eggs, lightly beaten
-icing sugar, to dust

Method
1. Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/Gas 4. Butter the sides and base of a 23cm/9in cake tin.

2. Place the biscuits into a food processor and pulse until the mixture resembles rough breadcrumbs. Alternatively, place them into a plastic bag and bash with a rolling pin. Mix the crushed biscuits with the melted butter and press down into the base of the tin. Spread the blueberries over the base and chill in the fridge until needed.

3. Beat the cream cheese, sugar, vanilla extract and the eggs together in a large bowl until smooth and creamy. Pour over the top of the blueberries and then bake in the oven for 40 minutes, or until it is a pale golden-brown and only wobbles slightly when you gently shake the tin.

4. Remove from the oven and allow to cool in the tin for about 10-15 minutes, then run a knife around the edge to loosen it and carefully remove the cheesecake from the tin. Transfer to a serving plate. Sprinkle over a few blueberries, then dust with icing sugar.

5. Cut into slices to serve. This cheesecake is best eaten when it is at room temperature.
